**Initial Ideas**

Essential:
-	A GUI to give the user options on what to display
-	Use statistics to visually display the weekly development of COVID-19 infections and deaths.
-	The visualisation should include modelling and forecasting results.
-	Display the expected number of infections and deaths in the next 2, 4 and 6 weeks.
-	Data should be output to a PDF format. 
-	Use linear functions and linear regression to forecast the data. 

Optional:
-	Information on how each season increases or decreases the number of infections/deaths. 
-	Information on how age affects number of infections/deaths.
-	A second modelling method to forecast infections/deaths and compare to linear regression. 

Ideas:
-	Bar graphs to show infections per season
-	Bar graph to show infections per age group
-	GUI gives option of two modelling methods (linear regression and another option)
