# Requirements and Risk Log

*In this markdown document, list all of the requirements that you have identified for your product so far.*

# Requirements

*List several user stories (no more than 8) that describe the product requirements. For each user story that you include:*

* *Include a URL link to the Jira user-story issue.*
* *Paste in the Story Description and Story Summary from Jira.  Attempt to keep story summaries in the form taught in the lectures, i.e. the form "As a [persona], I [want to], [so that]".  Feel free to update your Jira issues into this form if they are not already.*
* *Give details of whether this story has been assigned to someone yet, and whether it is completed yet.*
* *Include a screenshots of any relevant attachments.*

*In addition to user stories (which is the main thing we are trying to teach for agile), try to include one or two other requirement modelling techniques, e.g. as listed in the lecture.*

*Try to group the requirements under two sub-headings: functional requirements, and non-functional requirements.*

*When marking this section we will be looking to see your team has understood the correct way to represent User-Stories and one or more other requirement modelling methods, and the requirements listed are giving as much relevant information for the development team as possible.*

## Risk Log

*In this section list the risks you have identified for your project.  For each Risk identified:*

* *Include a URL link to the Jira risk issue.* 
* *Paste in the Risk's Description and Summary from Jira.  Also state the Impact and Likilihood.*
* *Give details of whether this story has been assigned to someone yet, and whether it is completed yet.*
* *Include, from the Jira description / comments, details of what mitigating actions are being taking and by whom.*

*When marking this section we will be looking to see several realistic risks have been noted, and are actively being tracked and mitigated against.*
