Product Context


Legal

The information collected has come from the UK Government website https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/cases and https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/deaths each of which contain the statistics of both deaths and cases of COVID 19 in the UK and are under the Open Government Licence which includes the free use to "copy, publish, distribute and transmit the Information", "adapt the Information" and "exploit the Information commercially and non-commercially for example, by combining it with other Information, or by including it in your own product or application." all of which allow for our product to use the information displayed on the website in the product.

A 3rd party source of code used for the product is the Stack Overflow website https://stackoverflow.com which is under the "Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International" which states that users are able to "copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format" and "remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially." which entitles the product to make use of the code within it either in it's entirety or as a foundation to build other code onto.

Given that the NHS would have had funding to attain the information present in the goverment website the group believes that the product created should be given a proprietary licence which would require a fee to be paid in order to run the code.
The fee will be used to compensate the members for their work on the product to display the information in an easily accessible and catered view.


Ethical

An ethical concern could be the impact such data could have on society which, if used incorrectly, could be used to spread false information reguarding an incredibly serious topic casuing possible panic amongst the public.
To prevent such an outcome, the data is being handled with care and a final product displays the correct information in an apporpraite fashion.

Another ethical concern of the group would be the reusing of code from other sources without the permission of the creator.
In order to avoid such an issue, any code used from another source is taken from free use websites such as code blog/help sites and in most cases the code is not taken exactly, instead used to provide more understanding of the inner workings of the code so that a version more suitable for the product can be created.


Health and Safety

Given the sensitive subject matter in the context of the task it is possible for mental health to take a decline with prolonged exposure.
Furthermore, all work is done on computers it is possible for there to be physical issues from remaining seated for long periods of time such as spinal injury.
To add to this, prolonged exposure to blue light, emitted from screens, can negatively affect the eyes of those exposed to it, causing eye strain.
To help the mental and physical health of each member, members are advised to take regular breaks from their screens to reduce their exposure to the subject matter and blue light as well as allow them to move from their seated position. All of which will help both the mental and physical health of the members
