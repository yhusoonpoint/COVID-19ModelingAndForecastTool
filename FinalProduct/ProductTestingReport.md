## Testing Performed
| Test ID | Test Case | Expected | Actual | Result | Comments |
|---------|-----------|----------|--------|--------|----------|
|1|Initial Window|All the buttons should be displayed and the NHS logo but no graph should be displayed.|I ran the code and the window opened up with all the buttons, NHS logo at the top, and dropdown boxes. There was no graph as expected.|Pass|Image 1 below shows the initial window.|
|2|Drop down box to Select the information Displayed|There should be 6 options to choose from: 1.New Cases 2.New Deaths 3.New Cases & Deaths 4.Cumulative Cases 5.Cumulative Deaths 6.Cumulative Cases & Deaths. Each of these options should display a different graph.|There are 6 options appear at the top to choose and as you scroll down the options show up. I tested all the 6 options and the graph updated accordingly to display the desired option selected.|Pass|Images 2, 3 and 4 show the options New Cases, New Deaths, New Cases & Deaths selected, and the graph updated. Image 5 shows all the 6 options displayed and the option Cumulative Cases & Deaths selected, and the graph is updated.|
|3|Update Graph button|When clicked on the button the graph should be updated to the desired options that the user has selected.|The graph updates with all the options available. I have tested various different possible options and every option works as the graph updates accordingly.|Pass|Images 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 show the button works as all the graphs are updated when the desired option is selected.|
|4|Create PDF button|This button should display a save as option so it can save anywhere on the userâ€™s computer. The PDF should be created and saved to the users desired location on the computer.|When clicked on the button the save as option is displayed and I chose to save it on my desktop. The PDF was created and saved to the desktop with the file name as COVID-Report.pdf so it is in the correct format. I opened the PDF file, and the desired graph is saved.|Pass|Images 6 and 7 show that the PDF is created and saved on the desktop. Image 8 shows the graph once the pdf is opened.|
|5|Display Data From dropdown box|There should be 9 options in the dropdown box which are: 1)All data 2)2 weeks 3)4 Weeks 4)6 Weeks 5)8 weeks 6)10 Weeks 7)3 Months 8)6 Months 9)1 Year The graph should only display the option selected so for example if the option 2 weeks has been selected then the graph must only display data for 2 weeks.|All 9 options display in the dropdown box or can scroll to see options one by one. I have tested the 9 options and the data is displayed only for the selected option. I have tested this along with the Select the Information displayed button so for the New Cases & deaths as well as Cumulative Cases & Deaths. All the options work and the graph updates and displays correctly.|Pass|Image 9 shows all the options are displayed and the first option was chosen so all the data is displayed. The options display at the top near the NHS logo but this is due to the screen size. However, on a larger screen the dropdown box is formatted correctly.|
|6|Prediction Length dropdown box|The dropdown box should display 4 options: 1.None 2.Next 2 Weeks 3.Next 4 Weeks 4.Next 6 Weeks When any of the 4 options is selected the graph should draw a green line for the prediction.|All 4 options are available in the dropdown box, and I have tested all the options. The graph correctly predicts with a green line. I have also tested by changing the information to display to New Cases & Deaths and also for Cumulative Cases & Deaths, as expected the graph updates and predicts.|Pass|Image 10 shows the prediction for the next 2 weeks. The options display at the top near the NHS logo but this is due to the screen size.However, on a larger screen the dropdown box is formatted correctly|
|7|Algorithm dropdown box|There should be 3 options: 1.Linear Regression 2.Logistic regression 3. Support Vector Machines|The 3 options are displayed in the dropdown box, and I have tested all 3 options. The graph updates and displays the graph according to the selected option.|Pass|Image 11 shows linear regression graph. Image 12 shows logistic regression graph and image 13 shows the support vector machines graph.The options display at the top near the NHS logo but this is due to the screen size. However, on a larger screen the dropdown box is formatted correctly.|
|8|Highlight Highest Date checkbox|The highest week on the graph should be pinpointed in the colour green|I clicked on the box next to the Highlight Highest Date and a blue tick shows up on the box. I clicked on the update graph button and the highest date was pinpointed in the colour green.|Pass|Image 14 shows the highest date highlighted on the graph.|
|9|Highlight Lowest Date checkbox|The lowest week on the graph should be pinpointed in the colour purple and a blue tick should appear in the box when clicked on it.|I performed the exact same test as the Highlight Highest Date for the Highlight Lowest Date checkbox and as expected the blue tick appears once the box has been checked and once the graph has been updated the lowest date is pinpointed in the colour purple. Moreover, the date of highest and lowest is displayed on the graph and the number of new cases at the highest date and lowest date.If the option New Cases & Deaths is chosen, then highest and lowest date is highlighted on the new cases line graph separately to the new deaths line graph, so each line graph is highlighted.|Pass|Image 15 shows the lowest date highlighted on the graph.Image 16 shows both the highest and lowest date highlighted on the graph with a prediction. The highlighted points overlap as they are in the same place or very close to each other. However, this would not be an issue on a larger screen|
|10|Accessible View|||Pass|Image 17 shows the accessible view window.|
