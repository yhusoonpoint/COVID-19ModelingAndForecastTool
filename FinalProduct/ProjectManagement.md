# Project Management Log

## Project management discussion

As a team we continued to attempt to make the most progress possible by assigning tasks to each team member based on their coding confidence. This meant that everyone was still able to participate and add value to the program. As team leader Adam oversaw this, and ensured the tasks were logged on Jira so that everyone could be held accountable and also so that we could track development progress. We continued to utilise scrum meetings as they were an effective way of monitoring progress and coming together as a team to discuss any issues. The role of scrum master was alternated weekly between Adam and Kieran. 

The team has worked well together thanks to our great communication, which was split between in person meetings and using a group chat to keep up to date. If anyone needed help or support, they were able to reach out and speak to another member of the team. This meant that the project kept progressing at a positive rate, and each week we had development in the complexity of our code. We were able to maintain a log of what was being worked on and what had been completed by using Jira. Here we could assign tasks to individuals and monitor progress, which made it clear if people needed some extra support.

The scrum meetings allowed us to monitor what needed to be done, what was in progress and what had been completed. From this we could always see if anyone needed some support from fellow team members. As we became more comfortable using Jira, we started to include linking tasks to Epics, and also estimating story points for tasks. This has allowed us to use some of Jiraâ€™s charts to analyse and see what we were struggling with. Upon reflection one issue we had with our Jira tasks is that they were too broad, and to improve our productivity we could have split these into smaller tasks which could have been assigned to different people. 

Across the duration of the project we all stayed in constant communication through the use of our group chat as well as our weekly scrum meetings. One issue we encountered during the project was team members being unwell due to COVID. Unfortunately in this scenario there was not much that could be done, but we attempted to mitigate the problem by having other members pick up the workload.

As a team we used weekly stand-ups to keep the project moving in a positive direction. Some stand-ups lasted more than one week as the content and tasks included were large and required more time. These stand-ups were extremely useful in allowing us to discuss as a team what needs to be completed and how we can work as a team to do that. Below you can see our stand-ups and what tasks where assigned each week:

## Burndown-Charts Discussion

**Week 10 and 11:**
**Stand-up Jira Link:** https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=5714&view=reporting&chart=sprintRetrospective&sprint=4225 
This was the week before the Christmas break, and as you can see we created a lot of research tasks so that when we came back we could start on improving the code with the knowledge we had learnt. While everyone completed their research it was updated on Jira until we returned as a team and thus makes it seem like nothing was done. 

**Week 17 and 18:**
**Stand-up Jira Link:** https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=5714&view=reporting&chart=sprintRetrospective&sprint=4320
As you can see there is a drop in the story points at the start as this is us completing the tasks on Jira from the sprint. We then assigned new tasks specifically with converting our code from Java to Python. As you can see the story points are not that high as we didn't expect it to be too challenging, especially as our team are confident in Python.

**Week 20 and 21:**
**Stand-up Jira Link:** https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=5714&view=reporting&chart=sprintRetrospective&sprint=4458
This week everyone was busy adding their functionality to the program, and was our busiest week for commits to GitLab. An ongoing issue you can see is that we were not completing the tasks on Jira as soon as we completed them and instead waiting for the next sprint to do so. This makes it seem that no work was completed.

**Week 20 and 21:**
**Stand-up Jira Link:** https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=5714&view=reporting&chart=sprintRetrospective&sprint=4476
This last week as you can see had the most story points of any week. This is because along with adding finishing touches to our code we also had to assign tasks for documentation. The story points should go down to 0 once everyone has completed their documentation.

Upon reflection, our team need to make sure they are updating Jira with completed tasks so that the burndown chart can be more accurate. This will also allow us to issue more or less tasks depending on how much and how quick we get them done. Another issue we need to work on is breaking tasks down to subtasks with smaller story points so that we can see a greater change in the burndown chart. 

In order to improve the rate of tasks being completed over time, the group's completion of tasks must be faster which can be improved by reducing the difficulty of each task which may add more tasks but will take less time to complete. This can also be achieved by splitting big tasks down into smaller sub-tasks and spreading that out between multiple people.

## Product Backlog

This is our current Product Backlog, as you can see the only tasks that are yet to be completed are specific to the final documentation. Once all documentation is complete there will be no tasks left in the backlog.

## Other Areas
Here you can see our cumulative flow diagram of our issues over time. As you can see over time we are completing tasks in a positive manner and making progress, and we are always allocating new tasks to be completed.
