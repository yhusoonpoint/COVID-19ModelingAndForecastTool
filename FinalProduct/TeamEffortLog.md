# Team Effort Log

## Adam Akhlaq
Adam was the team leader for the project and also shared the responsibility of being the scrum master with Adam, swapping each week.

### Sprint 6 (University Week 10 & 11):
* (https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/B201161-100) The first task Adam undertook was to research and learn about Advanced Git Usage, specifically in terms of utilising branches for development of the code. This would prove useful later in the weeks as Adam was developing parts of the code without interfering with other peoples developments. 
* (https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/B201161-108) As team leader Adam delegated tasks for everyone to work on for the coming weeks. The tasks were designed to improve functionality of the program, and improve usability.
* (https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/B201161-110) Another research task Adam completed was reading about stand-up meetings and how they can ensure the team remains on the same page.
* (https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/B201161-115) Adam started researching how he could get the images of graphs onto the PDF rather than the raw data.
* (https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/B201161-124) As a team we decided the functionality we were looking to add would be better suited to Python and its tool set, therefore we started working on converting our code from Java to Python. 

### Sprint 7 (University Week 17 & 18):
* As team leader Adam made sure to hold a stand-up meeting with all present team members, this allowed everyone to express what they were working on and if anyone could help as they had finished their part. 
* (https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/B201161-125) In the first weeks back after the break, we worked on transferring the code to Python. Adam started by making the GUI layout similar so all functionality could be added on top. 
* (https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/B201161-115) After the GUI had been created, and others had converted their code. Adam was able to start initial work on getting the PDF output to display the graphs.
* (https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/B201161-126) Adam assisted Kieran in adding the graphs to the GUI by together coming up with a solution to show a reasonable number of increments on the X-axis.

### Sprint 8 (University Week 20 & 21):
* As team leader Adam made sure to hold a stand-up meeting with all present team members, this allowed everyone to express what they were working on and if anyone could help as they had finished their part. 
* (https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/B201161-115) In this sprint Adam's main focus was getting the PDF functionality working. Adam was able to achieve this and the program now allows a PDF to be generated that will display the current graph on screen.
* As Adam had finished his section of the code, Adam researched into what would need to be completed for the report documentation and started assigning tasks to each person, in order to balance the workload. 

### Sprint 9 (University Week 21 & 22):
* As team leader Adam made sure to hold a stand-up meeting with all present team members, this allowed us to evaluate if there was anything we would have to stop working on or if we could come together to help.
* (https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/B201161-131) Adam completed half of the team effort log alongside Kieran, and referenced Jira to make sure all efforts were logged. 
* (https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/B201161-133) Adam completed the Product Management Report for the final documentation.

### Code Completed
##### Sprint 7 #####
* Adam worked alongside Kieran in converting the GUI, as well as starting to look at ways to add the graph to the GUI. Gitlab commit link: 6c5520d53d73973cabaa48b61e975954a48016a3
* Adam worked with Kieran in trying to get the x-axis to be dynamic which they were able to do successfully. Gitlab commit link: ebbd4f2d25afc7e546b9368943af4f4a1a5fed14

##### Sprint 8 #####
* Adam worked on the section of code in sprint 8. First he managed to get a test graph to be outputted to a PDF format. Gitlab commit link: d1c91684d9c2f6147f264a15ff802e9475a9ea90
* Adam then managed to get the create PDF function to save the current graph to a PDF rather than a test graph.

##### Sprint 9 #####
* Adam combined everyone's code from their individual branches into the main master branch code file. Gitlab commit link: 47be2773fe3e8521f2ae2089a50b7be189c4d785 (There is more commits, however this is the final one)

## Kieran Andrews
Kieran shared the responsibility of being the scrum master with Adam, swapping each week. He also helped Adam keep the Jira up-to-date and suggested what tasks to assign to team members.

### Sprint 6 (University Week 10 & 11):
* (https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/B201161-101) The first task Kieran completed was to research and learn about Advanced Git Usage. Learning about how to utilise branches for development of the code was particularly important as it was required for each team member to work on the code simultaneously. This would prove useful as it allowed Kieran to work on the code without interfering with other peoples developments. 
* (https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/B201161-108) Kieran helped Adam to decide what tasks each team member should be assigned to in regard to improving the code/program. These tasks were based on the improvements suggested for the MVP.
* (https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/B201161-109) Kieran also completed research on stand-up meetings and how they can ensure the team remains on the same page. Kieran did this by reading through the information on the link provided.
* (https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/B201161-116) Kieran started researching how he could get the program to use live data rather than a static data file. He also started researching how he could get the graph to display a specified length of time from the current date on the graph.
* (https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/B201161-124) As a team we decided the functionality we were looking to add would be better suited to Python and its tool set, therefore we started working on converting our code from Java to Python. 

### Sprint 7 (University Week 17 & 18):
* (https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/B201161-125) In the first weeks back after the break, we worked on transferring the code to Python. Kieran helped Adam in converting the GUI and getting all the inputs in the correct position with the suitable type (e.g. dropdown, button or checkbox) and with the required options (for the dropdowns).
* (https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/B201161-116) After the GUI had been created, and others had converted their code, Kieran managed to get the dropdown that allows the user to select a specific time period to work as expected.
* (https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/B201161-126) Kieran and Adam worked together in adding the graphs to the GUI by together coming up with a solution to show a reasonable number of increments on the X-axis.

### Sprint 8 (University Week 20 & 21):
* Kieran assisted Adam with holding a stand-up meeting with all present team members to ensure that everyone understood what they needed to complete and express any concerns they may have. 
* (https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/B201161-116) In this sprint Kieran concentrated on completing his remaining code. He was able to find a way of downloading and saving the data file from the NHS website, and created a function that was called upon running the program to ensure the data was always up-to-date.
* Kieran discussed how to assign the documentation around the team members to ensure that everyone had an even workload. They decided that they should do 1 and 1/2 (shared the team report) pieces of documentation, as they had finished their code, with the remaining 4 team members doing 1 piece each.

### Sprint 9 (University Week 21 & 22):
* (https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/B201161-117) As a result of the stand-up meeting Kieran decided to help Aaran and Carol with the highlight highest and lowest functionality as, although they had partially completed the code they were unable to combine their code and implement it successfully. Kieran was able to get the highlight highest and lowest functionality to work as required.
* (https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/B201161-130) Kieran and Adam completed half of the team effort log each as that was spare (There were 7 pieces of documentation between 6 team members).
* (https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/B201161-129) Kieran completed the Final Product Demonstration Report for the final product documentation.

* Kieran, along with Adam, made the X-axis dynamic (prevents x-axis labels overlapping). There is another commit just after with one change (line 53: graph.invert_xaxis()) to ensure the labels are in the correct order. Gitlab commit link: 2565dd15dcedad42b190a887ecf1c348351d9533
* Kieran also got the accessible view feature working, with one of the lines being dashed on a multi-line graph when selected. Gitlab commit link: a45b4254f4bf525ee31fb1d4ea940788f5a600b8

##### Sprint 8 #####
* Kieran was able to implement a function, that was called at the start of the program everytime it was run, that downloaded and saved the latest version of the data file from the NHS website. Gitlab commit link: ecf67b208e64862ef7e961af281813384567f75e
* Kieran fixed an issue with the sizing of the graphs on different operating systems. Gitlab commit link: 1f94c41bfd0ed98741da242687815ae99d2b4201

##### Sprint 9 #####
* Kieran used the research and code completed by Carol and Aaron on the highlight highest and lowest week feature in order to get the functionality working as required. Gitlab commit links: (1) 53ecf8a1ced6969c226b8a4c7080f2f67d6b516a (2) 76e2e3285786a455870a145c5e6e0c985b8cb1d7
* Kieran made a few small changes on the code once it had been combined back into the master branch. He made the window a fixed size, made it so the graph only ever updates when the update button is pressed and also made a change so that a PDF is not created everytime the graph is update, instead a PDF is only created when the create PDF button is pressed (1 in Gitlab commit links). Kieran also made a change to the create PDF function that allowed the user to select the name and location of the PDF rather than it being preset (2 in Gitlab commit links). Gitlab commit links: (1) eefb362caa60c35a84e94520b6fa47dd904caa32 (2) 1891b0a25efb8ddf8e4a8108215ac4d9bcb986f6
