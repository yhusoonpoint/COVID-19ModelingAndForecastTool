# Marketing Plan
## Customers
The NHS are likely to use this product as they can easily monitor the movement of all cases. Apart from the NHS, Research companies are most likely to use this as they can monitor the movement too and see the prediction for the next week. Those who are looking to analyse and compare data can also use this product to enhance their research. Regular people who are interested in such a product regarding Covid-19 statistics will benefit from this. Health experts should use this as a standardised form of data analysis as they have a variety of data to select from our buttons and drop-down menus. It is also very clear and visible for them. Those who work for institutions should consider using our product. This is because large institutions affect the spread of covid which will affect the statics on the NHS file. Furthermore, any company or group (and those who work for them) with large amounts of people would benefit from this.

## Economics
* What is the total size of your market?<br>
    It is hard to tell the approximate amount however, looking at only the NHS, there are roughly 1978 hospitals. If there is roughly 50% success rate with similar products, then the total market size would be roughly 989 hospitals.

* What percent share of the market will you have?<br>
    It is also hard to determine the percent share because we can not find similar products, and we also have no sales data to calculate roughly what it would be using a formula of business revenue dived by total industry revenue all multiplied by 100. Since similar products cannot be found, ideally it would be 100% and since we have no sales record, it would be roughly 0%. 

* What is the current demand in target market?<br>
    It was said to be high however the spread of covid has dropped in the year 2022, meaning the demand would be dropping. As we cannot find similar product the demand cannot be predicted.

* What are the trends in target market?<br>
    No current trends as covid is dropping, few or no people are talking about it.

## Competition
* Which other products are on the market, and what advantages can you offer over them?<br>
    At the moment, only the NHS website has a similar product that can show the forecast as well as prediction, but I do not believe they see it as a product. It is meant for users to track the rates now. An advantage we offer is a software with easy access to display various information at once. We also have different prediction algorithm as well different prediction length.

## Sales Forecast
* How many downloads / sales / shipped units could you realistically achieve in the first 12 months?<br>
    It depends on the promotion. The more people that notice the more that will sell. I estimate around 989 downloads + 30% of that. In total roughly 1,285 downloads.

* How much cash would that bring in?<br>
    Since this is made specifically for the NHS then it would be a one-off amount three hundred and fifty thousand pounds. But if other people are interested in it, then it could be sold for five thousand per unit.
